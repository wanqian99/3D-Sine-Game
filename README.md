# 3D-Sine-Game
Uol Graphics Programming CM2030 Final Project 1

https://3d-sine-game.vercel.app

This is a mini project done with P5.js, which uses sin to translate each box to their correct position. Lerp is used for smooth colour change of the boxes. Sliders are used to allow confetti count, box height and camera speed adjustment.
